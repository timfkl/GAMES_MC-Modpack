In order to use these mods, install Forge first (I used 1.16.4 - 35.1.0) http://files.minecraftforge.net/.
Once you have Forge, it will appear as one of the Minecraft versions in the launcher. In the .minecraft folder in Appdata/Roaming/Minecraft, rather than putting the mods into the newly created mod folder, create first a folder called "profiles", and then have a sub directory for this pack of mods. (I just called it Forge).
When you have this new folder, go to Edit the Forge Installation in the Minecraft Launcher, and set the Game Directory for it to your newly created sub directory.
After launching Forge, it will have created a new mods folder in your sub-directory. Put the mods in there.
