Install.bat should install all of the mods and make the profile if your copy of minecraft is on the same harddrive, and if minecraft is installed in the default location. If not, you might have to do this all manually.



**Manual Install:**
First, download Forge, downloading it in the location of your Minecraft directory. (Usually in Appdata/Roaming)

Once you have Forge, it will appear as one of the Minecraft versions in the launcher. In the .minecraft folder in Appdata/Roaming/Minecraft, rather than putting the mods into the newly created mod folder, create first a folder called "profiles", and then have a sub directory for this pack of mods. (Call it GAMESModpack1.0 or whatever you like).

When you have this new folder, go to Edit the Forge Installation in the Minecraft Launcher, and set the Game Directory for it to your newly created sub directory.

After launching Forge, it will have created a new mods folder in your sub-directory. Put the mods from the mod folder here in there.
